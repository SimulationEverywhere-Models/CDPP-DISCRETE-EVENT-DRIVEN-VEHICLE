IMPORTANT NOTE: Must Build the project folder before running the simulations using batch files.

The batch files simulate (using simu.exe) the different atomic and coupled models in the system's design.

Each batch file is named after the model it simulates.

The simulations use event files to get event inputs for each of the models. They output corresponding log files containing the simulation results.

For more information on the behaviour of the system and its composing models, refer to the report document.
